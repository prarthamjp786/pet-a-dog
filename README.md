Then run node server. This command will start the server.

In your browser enter localhost:8000

You will see a login screen. First you have register with your email enter all the fields all the fields have constraints.

After you register it will redirect you to login page then login with email and password that you used for registration.

After you login it will take you to the home page of the application.

There you will see a greet message and a button for logout.

If you click on logout it will take you to the login screen and you cannot see the home page as a guest user.
